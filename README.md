CNUOS is an educational operating system project for AMD64 hardwares. It is written in C and is intended to be completed by student's own implementation.

## Building

### Prerequisities

### Testing and Debugging

#### Installing QEMU

#### Start and Attaching a Debugger

## How It Works

## Architecture

## Challenges
 * [ ] Process

 * [ ] Thread and Basic Concurrency

 * [ ] Memory Management and Isolation

 * [ ] Shell and Interprocess Communication (IPC)

 * [ ] Filesystem (MFS)
